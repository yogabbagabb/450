\begin{definition}
    An ordinary differential equation is a differential equation where the state vector
    depends only on one variable, usually time. A partial differential equation has the
    state vector depend on several variables.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    A partial differential equation is in implicit form, if for each derivative of the state
    vector $y$ that we denote by $y^k$, we have

    \[
        f(t, y,  y^2, \dots y^k) = 0
    \]

    By contrast, an ODE is said to be in explicit form is we can write $y^k$ as

    \[
        f(t, y', y'', \dots ,y^{k-1})
    \]

    
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    The order of an ODE is the degree of the highest derivative that occurs in the implicit
    form representation of an ODE.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
    We will restrict  our attention to first order ODEs, for suppose we are given an explicit ODE, then we can define $u_k = y^{k} = f(t, y, y'', \dots y^{k-1})$ and we will find that

    \begin{align*}
        \begin{bmatrix}
            u_2 \\
            u_3 \\
            u_4 \\
        \end{bmatrix}
        =
        \begin{bmatrix}
            u_1' \\
            u_2' \\
            u_3' \\
        \end{bmatrix}
    \end{align*}
    which is a system of $kn$ first order equations (here, realize that $u_k$ is a vector in $\R^n$).
\end{remark}
