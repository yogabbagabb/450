    So what? Why is this important? We wish to work with $H$ to determine its eigenvalues.
    The foregoing reveals that we will need to compute $K_n$ if we wish to compute $H$. The problem is that $K_n$ will tend to multiples of the dominant eigenvector of $A$, since $K_n$ is obtained by performing power iteration a few times on $x_0$. This makes $K_n$ highly ill conditioned, so that the Hesenberg form that we would obtain by mat-mat multiplication is likely not useful. What we will therefore do is that we will find a $Q_nR_n$ factorization for $K_n$.
